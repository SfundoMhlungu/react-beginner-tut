React has quickly become the go-to choice for building modern web applications, and for a good reason. If you're just starting out in web development or want to get up to speed with React, this tutorial is for you. We'll take you step by step through the fundamentals of React, so you can start building your own amazing web projects.



React was developed by Facebook in 2011, open sourced in 2015 and has since gannered a large and active community of developers, becoming the most popular JavaScript library with over 200k stars on [github](https://github.com/facebook/react). 


here are some well known companies utilizing React to meet their complex front-end needs include: 



## Introduction to React: An overview of what React is and how it works


React is a JavaScript library that is widely used for building user interfaces for web applications, with the ability to <strong>efficiently</strong> render dynamic and interactive content, made possible by the concept of a virtual DOM, which allows React to update only  specific parts of the DOM that have changed, rather than re-rendering the entire page. 

React is also known for its flexibility and modularity. It allows developers to create reusable components that can be easily shared and composed to build complex user interfaces, a React component can be compared to a lego piece, combined together with other pieces can create a complex beautiful structure, React gives you that ability, to easily create lego pieces and compose them together to create a complex user interface.

Making React an ideal choice for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

Here is a simple hello world in React.


```jsx


function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

```

Greeting is a component,and takes a name prop(short for property) and uses it to render a greeting. You can use this component like this:

```jsx
<Greeting name="World" />

```

This will render a heading element with the text "Hello, World!".

Now that you have a basic understanding of what React is and how it works, it's time to set up your development environment.


## Setting up a React Development Environment

To start working with React, you'll need a few things:
   1. A text editor: This is where you'll write your code. There are many options to choose from, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), or [lite-xl](https://lite-xl.com/).
   2. A web browser: This is where you'll see the results of your code. Any modern browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari will work.
   3. A package manager: This is a tool that helps you manage dependencies (libraries and frameworks that your code depends on). The most popular package managers for JavaScript are [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). 

To set up a basic React project, you'll need to install Node.js and create a new project using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Here's how you can do that:

   1. Download and install Node.js from the official website. This will also install npm, which you'll use to install other packages.

  2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

  3. Run the following command to create a new React project:

```cmd
    npm create vite@latest

```

then follow the prompts.

```cmd
Ok to proceed? (y) y
√ Project name: my-project
√ Select a framework: » react
√ Select a variant: » react


```

This will create a new directory called my-project with a basic React setup. To start the development server, navigate to the new directory(`cd my-project`) and run the following commands:

```cmd

// install all the npm dependencies needed for React development
npm install
// open the project in vscode 
code .
// start the development server
npm run dev

```

Quick tip : you can chain commands in the command prompt, I am using windows, they  work in other operating systems too, maybe a different syntax.

```cmd

cd my-project && npm install &&  code . && npm run dev

```

This will start the development server and open a new browser window with your React app, if not copy and paste the url `` in a new tab of any browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser.

before we build our first component let's go through the project structure and important files generated by vite to get started.

1. The `src` folder 

The folder with most action, this is where you'll find entry components to your app, and will add new components, `main.jsx` is the entry file, when your React app boots up it's the first file to be loaded, the `.jsx` tells vite we will be using javascript to write our component, `.tsx` is  typescript.


```jsx

// mounting the React app to an element with id of root(you can find the element in index.html)
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)


```

This div will carry the entire React app, this is how its rendered to the browser. 

```xml
 <div id="root"></div>

```

on a succeful boostrap `main.jsx` will render the App component `<App />` from the  `App.jsx` file, 

```jsx

import App from './App'

 <React.StrictMode>
    <App />  
  </React.StrictMode>


```


`App.jsx` exports the App `export default App` component which renders a div 


```jsx 

  return (
    <div className="App">

    </div>
  )
```

and has a simple state.

```jsx

const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

```

that updates when the button count is clicked 


```jsx

   <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
          count is {count}
   </button>

```
The component than re-renders based on the state change.

Unless you already have experience with React.js or similar libraries, you won’t understand everything about this first example right away, and that’s fine. Each concept introduced here will be covered in detail in the coming
sections, so don’t worry if some parts look arbitrary or magical to you!

Now that you have your development environment set up, it's time to start building your first React components.

## Component 

draft 

component breakdown 

Before we technically define what a component is, let's break it down a bit, what makes a react component. 

1. A react component is a function, that takes an optional object as an argument.

```jsx

function Component(props){

}


```

the argument is called props, and contains values passed into the component by other components, just like normal function arguments, we will cover props and state later.


2. The function returns a view, commonly represented as JSX - a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript.



```jsx

function Component(props){

    return (
        <div>I am JSX</div>
    )
}


```

3. The function component can encapsulate data and functionality, in itself.

You can render data in the component and call functions in the view, inside curly braces `{data}`,  `onClick={() => functionCall()}`. 

```jsx 

import {useState} from "react"

function Component(props){

const [data, setData] = useState("I am a data string")


const submit = () => {
    console.log("I am functionality")
}


 return (
        <div>{data}</div>
    )
    
}


```

4. You can nest as many components as you like. 


```jsx


function Component1(props){
 

   return <div>component one </div>

}



function Component2(props){


    return (
        <div>
          <Component1/>
       </div>
       )

}


```

Therefore a component is a JavaScript function that returns a view(UI), and encapsulates it's own logic, data and functionality.

let's create the following card component.


create a new folder `components` under `src` and a new file `Card.jsx`.

```jsx

function Card(props){

    return (
        <div>
            <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100"/>
           <div>
               <h2>Random Card</h2>
               <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?</p>
           </div>
        
        </div>
    )

}


// each jsx or tsx file need to export a component, 
export default Card



```

clear the App component in `App.jsx`, and import the Card component.

```jsx
import Card from "./components/Card"

function App() {


  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Card/>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App


```

you can directly use the style attribute in jsx, to style elements along `className`, which is a class in a normal css context, React uses `className` because `class` is a reserved JavaScript keyword.

To define inline styles in React, you use the following syntax `style={{property: value}}`, for example `style={{backgroundColor: "gray"}}`, properties are camel cased, while values are strings.


let's apply some basic styling to our card 

```jsx



function Card(props){

    return (
        <div style={{backgroundColor: "#121212", padding: "1em", borderRadius: "1.5em"}}>
          <img src="https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100" style={{borderRadius: "50%"}}/>
           <div>
              <h2>Random Card</h2>
               <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?</p>
           </div>
        
        </div>
    )

}


```

you can isolate the styles to a seperate css file, and import it for example `import "./Card.css`, your first custom component, that's progress, now all we need is to make it functional(events) and stateful(Hooks) we will explore these concepts later, 

Something to keep in mind as we move along, is that React components are self contained, and isolated from each other, the only way the can communicate is via props and external state. 


for example we can have two of the same components, and they won't know about each other, affecting the state of one will not affect the other.


```jsx

<div>
   <Card>
   <Card>
</div>



```

each card is it's own independent piece of the UI, a new Lego Brick, although created from the same `Card` component., 

another thing to know about the returned jsx is, you cannot have two adjacent elements, you can only have one parent inside the return statement, every other element needs to be nested inside this single parent.



wrong 

```jsx


    return (
        <div>
        
        </div>

        <div>

        </div>

    )



```

correct 


```jsx

    return (
        <div>
        
              <div>

              </div>

        </div>

       

    )


```


if you really need to have to adjacent elements, you can nest inside a react fragment `<></>` and does not add an extra element to the DOM.

```jsx

    return (
      <>
          <div>
          
          </div>


          <div>

          </div>
     </>
    )



```


now that you know a little more about components, let's zoom in a little bit and explore succintly jsx.


## JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript. It is an integral part of React and is used to define the structure of a React component.

Here is an isolated example of JSX:

```jsx

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    </div>
  );


```

This component uses JSX to render a div element with a heading and a paragraph element inside it.

JSX looks similar to HTML, but it has a few key differences. For example, you can use JavaScript expressions inside JSX by enclosing them in curly braces. In the example above, the {props.name} expression is replaced with the value of the name prop when the component is rendered.

creating your components with JSX is optional but the most common, there are other methods, like `React.creatElement` which we will not explore here. mastering the idea of curly braces in jsx is essential to understand the dynamic and interactive part of React.

now that you a little more about jsx, let's explore ways to pass data between components, using `prop`, 


## Prop and State 

Props (short for "properties") are values that are passed to a component from its parent. They are a way for a parent component to pass data to a child component.

let's assume for example we have an array of data, an image url, title and description. 


```js

const data = [
  {url: "https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100", 
   title: "Random Card 1", 
   description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?"     
  },
  {url: "https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100", 
   title: "Random Card 2", 
   description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?"     
  },
  {url: "https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100", 
   title: "Random Card 3", 
   description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?"     
  }
]


```

we can directly create each card for each object in data by hand that would be error prone and inefficient, what if we add more data or remove data, we have to manually adjast the cards also, 

that is what the props solve, we can create the same component passing in different data, pseudo-code to do that will be the following

```text

for each individualObject in data
    render card 
    with individualObject data



```
in React this is called rendering a list, recall what we said about curly braces and JavaScript, that's how we render a list in React 


on top of the app component paste the data array, and remove the single card

```jsx 
const data = [
  {url: "https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100", 
   title: "Random Card 1", 
   description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?"     
  },
  {url: "https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100", 
   title: "Random Card 2", 
   description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?"     
  },
  {url: "https://source.unsplash.com/user/c_v_r/100x100", 
   title: "Random Card 3", 
   description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Modi, blanditiis?"     
  }
]



function App() {


  return (
    <div className="App">
      
    </div>
  )
}

export default App


```


we can use the map function to render each object in the array, like so.


```jsx

  {data.map((d, i)=> {
        return <Card/>
      })}

```

we are simply looping over the array and returning the card for each data object in the array,
update the app component, and you should see 3 card components rendered.

```jsx

function App() {


  return (
    <div className="App">
      
     {data.map((d, i)=> {
        return <Card/>
      })}
    </div>
  )
}

```

all we need to do now is pass the data to `Card`, simply by assigning a value to a property that will be accessed in the props, `property=value`

```jsx
 return <Card  url={d.url} description={d.description} title={d.title}/>

```

update app as follows

```jsx
 return (
    <div className="App">
      {data.map((d, i)=> {
        return <Card url={d.url} description={d.description} title={d.title}/>
      })}
    </div>
  )

```

React will construct an object(props object), representing the data passed from parent to child.

```js

props = {
  url: "url at that particular iteration", 
  description: "description at that particular iteration",
  title: "title at that particular iteration"
}

```

and we can access the data from the child via the `props` argument.

```jsx

function Card(props){


    return (
       
        <div style={{backgroundColor: "#121212", padding: "1em", borderRadius: "1.5em"}}>
           <img src={props.url} style={{borderRadius: "50%"}}/>
           <div>
               <h2>{props.title}</h2>
               <p>{props.description}</p>
           </div>
        
          </div>
      
    )
}


export default Card

```

instead of hard coding data, we are using data passed from the parent, if you look at the browser you should three cards, with different data, to see the magic of React add more data of the similar format, or even remove the cards will adapt, this is the `dynamic content` part of React, rendering lists is propably the most useful and common React pattern you will use for most of your React applications.

Props are read-only, which means that a component can't modify its own props. If a component needs modify state we have hooks for that which are covered in a seperate article along event handling, you have actually encountered one the `useState` hook, 

This is a good base to stop and avoid a long article, I suggest immediatley after finishing this one you continue on to the hooks article,
